    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Outside of programming I enjoy many artistic hobbies, like dance and
      digital art. I'm actively part of my college's institutional contemporary
      dance group and I draw from time to time and publish my art on instagram.

      I also enjoy playing indie videogames, such as The binding of isaac,
      Hylics, yume 2kki and more.

      I consider having a healthy work/play dynamic is important to prevent
      burnout, so I tend to keep my hobbies and my personal projects separate.
